//Feb 11, Data Structures
//Learn Big Oh Notation, Big Omega Notation, Big Theta Notation and Big Alpha Notation for counting operations
//Every "=" is one operation, accessing arrays is one, add/subtract/divide/multiply is one
//f(n) is of order  g(n)
//100n^2 - 1000n + 10^6 <-- f(n) is "big theta" of f(n^2)
//Make sure to know correct Big O vs Big Theta. Big Theta is the highest degree of a polynomial, not Big O like in math
//Binary search is Big O of log of n

//Efficiency: Do NOT recompute
//How to write a String back
//Merge sort is THE fastest sorting method by far

//standard template library, stl for project 2
